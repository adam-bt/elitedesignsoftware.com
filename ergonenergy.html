      Chief Financial Officer, Greg Evans recently made a point of

      congratulating the team of people who worked to reduce the run time of an

      important ellipse report from 15 minutes down to just

      seconds.<br><br>&#8220;That is a great effort and shows how we all can deliver

      continuous improvement,&#8221; Greg said.<br><br>That team of people consisted

      of SPARQ&#8217;s Ayaz Esmail and Scott Thomson from the Business Intelligence

      Team and Adam Clinckett (Elite Design Software) from the ERP Support Team.  <br><br>The report that

      Greg Evans was referring to is the ECA900 (Accounting Entry) Ellipse

      report, which is used by Ergon and ENERGEX to reconcile accounting entries

      during the financial month end period.<br><br>Before Ayaz, Scott and Adam

      did their magic, some versions of the report would take an average of 15

      minutes to run and could sometimes take more than 30 minutes during the

      busy month end reporting period. By reducing this time down to just

      seconds, they were able to make a significant contribution to the

      efficiency and productivity of Ergon&#8217;s finance operations.<br><br>The

      changes made to the report were proposed by Adam and involved a radical

      re-design of how the data for the report would be built. Adam worked

      closely with Scott and Ayaz to integrate the new design into the existing

      reporting framework and benchmark the performance of the new design

      against the old report. <br><br>Without the team&#8217;s in-depth technical

      knowledge of Ellipse, Oracle and Business Objects these changes would not

      have been possible. While being a testament to the technical capability of

      the SPARQ team, the work performed also demonstrates their strong

      commitment to SPARQ&#8217;s values of professionalism, teamwork and

      improvement.<br></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma color=#444444 size=1><SPAN
